## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check Existing Issues**
   - Search for similar bug reports
   - Add to existing issues if relevant

2. **Create Detailed Bug Reports**
   - Use the bug report template
   - Include steps to reproduce
   - Specify device/platform information
   - Attach screenshots or videos if helpful

### Suggesting Features

1. **Feature Request Process**
   - Check the roadmap for planned features
   - Open a new issue with the "enhancement" label
   - Describe the feature and its benefits
   - Discuss implementation approaches

### Code Contributions

1. **Before You Start**
   - Comment on the issue you want to work on
   - Wait for maintainer approval
   - Fork the repository

2. **Development Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Create a feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Make your changes
   # Test thoroughly
   
   # Commit with descriptive messages
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of changes"
   
   # Push to your fork
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   
   # Create a pull request
   ```

3. **Code Guidelines**

#### GDScript Style Guide

```gdscript
# Use snake_case for variables and functions
var player_speed = 5.0
var is_mobile_device = false

# Use PascalCase for classes and scenes
class_name PlayerController

# Add type hints
func move_player(direction: Vector3) -> void:
    pass

# Comment complex logic
# Calculate spawn position based on player location
var spawn_pos = player.global_position + Vector3(0, 0, -20)

# Use meaningful variable names
var obstacle_spawn_timer = 0.0  # Better than 't' or 'timer'

# Group related variables
# Movement settings
@export var speed = 5.0
@export var jump_velocity = 8.0
@export var move_speed = 3.0

# Audio references
@onready var jump_sound = $JumpSound
@onready var collect_sound = $CollectSound
```

#### File Organization

```
scripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ managers/          # Global managers (GameManager, AudioManager)
â”œâ”€â”€ player/           # Player-related scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ environment/      # Environment and world objects
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/              # User interface scripts
â””â”€â”€ utilities/       # Helper functions and utilities
```

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Manual Testing**
   - Test on desktop first
   - Export and test on Android device
   - Verify touch controls work properly
   - Check performance on lower-end devices

2. **Automated Testing**
   ```gdscript
   # Example test function
   func test_player_movement():
       var player = preload("res://scenes/Player.tscn").instantiate()
       add_child(player)
       
       # Test movement input
       Input.action_press("move_right")
       player._physics_process(0.016)  # Simulate one frame
       
       assert(player.velocity.x > 0, "Player should move right")
       
       player.queue_free()
   ```

### Asset Contributions

1. **3D Models**
   - Use Blender or other free 3D software
   - Keep polygon count low (< 1000 for most objects)
   - Export as .glb or .fbx format
   - Include proper UV mapping

2. **Textures**
   - Maximum 1024x1024 for most textures
   - Use power-of-2 dimensions
   - Provide diffuse, normal, and roughness maps
   - Save in PNG or JPG format

3. **Audio**
   - Use OGG Vorbis format
   - Keep sound effects under 5 seconds
   - Normalize audio levels
   - Provide both stereo and mono versions
